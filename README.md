# EtaThetaTau-Parse1.8.2

(One of the first apps I ever created. The code is ugly and it doesn't work anymore since Parse.com got shut down, but nostalgia is real)

This is an app that I created in my spare time for a Songfest group at Pepperdine University.It is definintely still a work in progress and there are a lot of features that I would like to add to it eventually. 

Current Issues:
- Webviews that play youtube videos do not stop playing when the fragment is paused/stopped after the back button is pressed. The current work around is ugly and needs to be fixed. 
- Count down timer does not handle negative time elegantly. Should be an easy fix, I just haven't gotten around to it yet. 

Future Features
- Full audio player to replace the current HTML based audio players
- A place to view notifications in the app
