# EtaThetaTau-Parse1.8.2

(edit: One of the first apps I ever created. The code is ugly and it doesn't work anymore since Parse.com got shut down, but nostalgia is real)

This is an app that I created in my spare time for a Songfest group at Pepperdine University.It is definintely still a work in progress and there are a lot of features that I would like to add to it eventually.
